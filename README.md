# Adult-Income-prediction 


This project aims to  predict whether a person, income exceeds US$50,000 annually.
## Problem Statement

The problem at hand is to determine if an individual's income is above or below the threshold of US$50,000.00. By leveraging the provided dataset and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals based on their income level.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Adult Income Dataset. It contains various features such as age, education level, occupation, and marital status, among others. These features will serve as inputs for our predictive model.

## Approach

Our approach involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: We will perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables as necessary.
2. Feature Engineering: We will analyze the existing features and create new features if needed to enhance the predictive power of our model.
3. Model Training: We will train different machine learning models using the preprocessed dataset and evaluate their performance.
4. Model Evaluation: We will assess the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to select the best-performing model.
5. Deployment: 

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/slowjerm1/Adult-Income-Dataset.git`
2. download the dataset at `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset` or from my data folder .
3. cd into the project folder and create virtual environment .
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Preprocess the data: Run the data preprocessing scripts to clean and transform the dataset.
6. Train the models: Run the model training scripts to train and evaluate different models.
7. Deploy the final model
